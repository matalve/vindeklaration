# E-label platforms, and which of them can be read

What `declaration-finder` has learned about where producers publish the
ingredient declaration when Systembolaget's page carries none. **Extend this
file; do not start over.** Every run that rediscovers a platform already listed
here has wasted its budget, and budget is the binding constraint.

Regulation (EU) 2021/2117 lets the ingredient list live behind a QR code
instead of on the bottle. The question for every platform is the same: **is the
declaration in the HTML the server returns, or only after JavaScript runs?**

Status as of 2026-07-31, across 14 producers and 79 wine records.

## Readable — server-rendered

| Platform | Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Winitas** | `{winery}.winitas-shop.de/elabel/{id}` | German webshop platform, Mosel and Rhine estates. Reach it from `artikel.html?artnr={artnr}`, following the "Nährwertangaben je 100 ml" link. **The elabel id is the shop's internal wine id and cannot be derived from the article number** — read it off the product page. Host serves no `robots.txt` (404). Full mandated set plus a "Übersetzen" selector; use German and say so. |
| **Producer's own site** | e.g. `weingut-philipp-kuhn.de/e-labels/{id}` | Some estates host their own. No pattern generalises, but worth a look before assuming a vendor platform. |
| **graphic-druck** | `e-label.graphic-druck.de/{yyyymmdd}/{slug}` | A print supplier's e-label service. The date segment appears to be a publication date and the slug carries the wine and vintage. Found via August Kesseler. |

## Unreadable — client-side rendering

| Platform | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Scantrust** | `matu.st4.ch/{token}` → `elabel.scantrust.com/default/#/?uid=…&api_key=…` | 828-byte shell, empty `<div id=app>`. **The uid and api_key are in the URL fragment, which is never sent to the server** — that host cannot serve the declaration by construction. The api_key is minted and signed per request, so it is an issued token and absolute under the agent's rules. Do not mine the JS bundles. `matu.st4.ch` answers `Disallow: /`, which is where the robots exception applies. |
| **IMERO** | `s.imero.io/c{id}` | Angular/Ionic SPA. Its catalogue lists per-article e-labels keyed by article number whose first two digits are the vintage, so a wine can be present for one vintage and absent for another — Dönnhoff and Robert Weil both failed this way. |

## Untested

**U-label** (`u-label.com`) has the widest EU footprint and no publicly linked
URL has turned up yet. Several sources describe it as *"U-label by Scantrust"*;
if they share architecture it will render client-side too. **That is an
inference, not evidence.** One publicly linked U-label URL from any producer
settles it cheaply, so grab one if you see it.

## Hosts with quirks, so nobody walks into them twice

- `www.vinifranchetti.com` — runs a `/*blackhole` bot trap. Read its
  `robots.txt` before touching it. Its `/product/` paths are disallowed and are
  an ordinary shop, so the e-label exception does not reach them.
- `passopisciaro.it` is an unrelated parked IIS host; `passopisciaro.com`
  redirects off-site. Neither is the producer.
- `domaines-faiveley.com` fails TLS with a self-signed certificate;
  `domainefaiveley.com` does not resolve.
- Hällåkra's Wix site is genuinely server-rendered, so "no declaration" there is
  a real observation rather than a fetching artefact.

## What the numbers say so far

**Most producers publish nothing at all.** Of 14 producers probed, three have a
readable e-label and two have an unreadable one; the rest put no ingredient
list anywhere reachable. The binding constraint is not rendering — it is
existence and discoverability.

**German small estates are where it works.** Hain, Philipp Kuhn and Kesseler are
all readable. The first international batch — Antinori, d'Esclans, Wittmann,
Sadie Family, Alheit — yielded nothing readable at all. If a batch has to be
prioritised, prioritise Germany.

**Vintage mismatch is the dominant rejection.** Producer sites show the current
release while Systembolaget's shelf runs a year behind: all five Klosterhof
wines were rejected on it, and Robert Weil's IMERO labels exist only for the
vintage after ours. Expect this to be the largest single category of failure in
any batch, and do not soften the rule to reduce it — a 2025 declaration is not
evidence about a 2024 bottle.

**A QR code that is never linked from the web is invisible.** "Not found" here
means not found by a crawler; it does not mean the producer published nothing.
Keep saying so.
